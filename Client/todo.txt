//DONE
//Matan suggests I add a typing sound for each "keystroke"
//of the updateScreen effect.

//Maybe break it into separate functions. On to write 
//sentences that will be pretty quick(50 milliseconds delay 
//for each character?) and a slower one for a small
//delay at the end of each word.

//Will replacing the p element with text area allow me to enter line breaks?
//Maybe I should just attach spans and <br> elements for each sentence
//In the update screen function.

//Need to add a "loading content..." message.

//Need to add menu navigation and login/signup implementation...
//menuButton.addEventListener('click', goToMenu);

//Fitoussi asks:
//1. Recreate the graduall text effect with pure css
//2. Add an error message on the console when failing to reach the server. 
//   The error message should recommend restarting the app via the "power off" button.
