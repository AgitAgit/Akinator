README CLARITY
When navigating to the "authentication" sections I expected to see an explanation of how to get a token,
and how and where do I need to include it.

It would be nice if each for each route explanation there would be a PROTECTED tag if it's a token
protected route.


ROUTE NAMES
post api/users/users repeats users twice. It would be more aesthetic if it were something like
api/users/ or api/users/add
